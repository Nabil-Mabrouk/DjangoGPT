# DjangoGPT
DjangoGPT provides a foundation template for building web applications that incorporate the power of GPT-based language models seamlessly. This template would enable developers to create web applications that interact with GPT models to perform high value tasks. It includes a landing page, a sales funnel and dashboard, a user dashboard to interact with the GPT model. This development is part of my free book [Quickstart Your GPT Business: Deploying Ideas Swiftly Using Django Templates](https://github.com/Nabil-Mabrouk/gpt-django-quickstart)
